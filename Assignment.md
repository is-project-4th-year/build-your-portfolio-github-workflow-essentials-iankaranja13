## 3. Learnings from the Git Crash Program

Write about **4 things** you expected to learn during the Git crash course (yes, we all came in with some big hopes 😅).
For each one, mention:

What you thought it would be like 
**(Expectation 👀)**
 **1.Concept: Git vs GitHub**

Expectation 👀 : I thought Git and GitHub were just two names for the same tool—they both helped save code, right?

Reality 😅: Git is the local version control system that tracks changes, while GitHub is an online platform where you host and share Git repositories.

Impact 💡: I finally understood where my project lives and how it's tracked. This helped me confidently push my portfolio project to GitHub and share the link on my CV!

**2. Concept: Commit Messages**

Expectation 👀 : I figured commit messages were just a formality—something short like "update" would do.

Reality 😅: Clear and meaningful commit messages actually help a lot! Especially when you want to go back and understand what changed and why.

Impact 💡: I started writing useful messages like Add responsive navbar or Fix image alignment bug, which helped me track my progress and debug issues faster in my portfolio.

**3. Concept: Merge Conflicts**

Expectation 👀 : I assumed Git would just figure things out for me when merging changes.

Reality 😅: When two branches change the same lines, Git asks you to decide what stays. It can be confusing—but it's also empowering once you get it.

Impact 💡: I ran into a merge conflict while adding a new section to my homepage, but learning how to resolve it helped me keep my code clean and gave me more control over my project.

**4. Concept: Cloning and Remote Repos**


Expectation 👀 : I thought cloning was only useful if I was working on someone else’s open-source project.

Reality 😅: Cloning is super useful even for my own work—especially when switching devices or collaborating.

Impact 💡: I cloned my portfolio repo onto a different laptop at school and kept working without missing a beat. Plus, I could show my progress from any device!

Example:

**🧠 What I Thought I'd Learn vs What I Actually Learned**
**1. Concept: Branching**

`Expectation 👀` : I thought branching was just for developers working on big apps—nothing I’d need for a small project.

`Reality 😅`: Turns out even solo devs need branches! It helped me avoid breaking my main code while testing new designs.

`Impact 💡`: I created a feature branch for my "About Me" section and merged it smoothly into the main branch after testing. Super useful!

## 4. Screenshots of Key GitHub Features

Include screenshots that demonstrate how you used GitHub to manage your project. For each screenshot, write a short caption explaining what it shows.

> Upload the screenshots to your GitHub repository and reference them here using Markdown image syntax:
> (you could just simply copy and paste the image into the Assignment.md)

```markdown
![Caption](path/to/your/image.png)
```

### A. Milestones and Issues

- Screenshot showing your milestone(s) and the issues linked to it.

### B. Project Board

### C. Branching

- Screenshot showing your branch list with meaningful naming.

### D. Pull Requests

- Screenshot of a pull request that’s either open or merged and linked to a related issue.

### E. Merge Conflict Resolution
