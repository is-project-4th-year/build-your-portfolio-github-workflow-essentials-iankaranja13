## 3. Learnings from the Git Crash Program

Write about **4 things** you expected to learn during the Git crash course (yes, we all came in with some big hopes ðŸ˜…).
For each one, mention:

What you thought it would be like 

**(Expectation ðŸ‘€)**
 **1.Concept: Git vs GitHub**

Expectation ðŸ‘€ : I thought Git and GitHub were just two names for the same toolâ€”they both helped save code, right?

Reality ðŸ˜…: Git is the local version control system that tracks changes, while GitHub is an online platform where you host and share Git repositories.

Impact ðŸ’¡: I finally understood where my project lives and how it's tracked. This helped me confidently push my portfolio project to GitHub and share the link on my CV!

**2. Concept: Commit Messages**

Expectation ðŸ‘€ : I figured commit messages were just a formalityâ€”something short like "update" would do.

Reality ðŸ˜…: Clear and meaningful commit messages actually help a lot! Especially when you want to go back and understand what changed and why.

Impact ðŸ’¡: I started writing useful messages like Add responsive navbar or Fix image alignment bug, which helped me track my progress and debug issues faster in my portfolio.

**3. Concept: Merge Conflicts**

Expectation ðŸ‘€ : I assumed Git would just figure things out for me when merging changes.

Reality ðŸ˜…: When two branches change the same lines, Git asks you to decide what stays. It can be confusingâ€”but it's also empowering once you get it.

Impact ðŸ’¡: I ran into a merge conflict while adding a new section to my homepage, but learning how to resolve it helped me keep my code clean and gave me more control over my project.

**4. Concept: Cloning and Remote Repos**


Expectation ðŸ‘€ : I thought cloning was only useful if I was working on someone elseâ€™s open-source project.

Reality ðŸ˜…: Cloning is super useful even for my own workâ€”especially when switching devices or collaborating.

Impact ðŸ’¡: I cloned my portfolio repo onto a different laptop at school and kept working without missing a beat. Plus, I could show my progress from any device!

Example:

**ðŸ§  What I Thought I'd Learn vs What I Actually Learned**
**1. Concept: Branching**

`Expectation ðŸ‘€` : I thought branching was just for developers working on big appsâ€”nothing Iâ€™d need for a small project.

`Reality ðŸ˜…`: Turns out even solo devs need branches! It helped me avoid breaking my main code while testing new designs.

`Impact ðŸ’¡`: I created a feature branch for my "About Me" section and merged it smoothly into the main branch after testing. Super useful!

## 4. Screenshots of Key GitHub Features

Include screenshots that demonstrate how you used GitHub to manage your project. For each screenshot, write a short caption explaining what it shows.

> Upload the screenshots to your GitHub repository and reference them here using Markdown image syntax:
> (you could just simply copy and paste the image into the Assignment.md)

```markdown
![Caption](path/to/your/image.png)
